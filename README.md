With this plugin you can add some extra fields on your default registration form of WordPress to adapt it to the GDPR.

== Description ==

= RGPD Fields Registration Form: making easy your GDPR adaptation =

This plugin has been created to **facilitate** the task of having to add a series of fields in the WordPress registration form for legal adaptation to the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).

These fields are mainly:
- A check to confirm acceptance of the privacy policy with a link to it.
- An optional field to explain details related to the purpose of the registration form.
- Several fields to give basic information about the person responsible for the data to be stored, its purpose, the rights the user has over his data, etc.

One of the most important features of RGPD Fields Registration Form is that when adapting the WordPress registration form it also conforms to the registration forms of third party plugins such as **LearnDash LMS**, the plugin for creating an online course platform in WordPress.

= How to Use =

Once the Plugin is activated, you only have to go to the Plugin page, where you can go from the main WordPress menu, and fill in the different fields related to the legal adaptation of the registration form. That's all!
